	// tick with nothing to hit. Every monkey of a dungeon carries the medal's
	// kill group, so the odds do not depend on the room. What the pile cost was
	// monsters - roughly fifteen times fewer per bot than the dungeon holds -
	// and the "whole dungeon in one line" players reported.
	//
	// So a bot in its first room of a visit rolls, by pid and weighted by how
	// many spawns each room holds, whether to stay or which door to take, and
	// walks there before it hunts. It yields to anything actually hitting it -
	// the walk is no reason to be killed - and to its own retreat, and resumes
	// when that is over. One door only: a second would meet the engine's door
	// block and the AI's own dwell, which are what keep a bot from being bounced
	// back, and past the first room the ordinary rotation carries it on. A bot
	// the engine has just moved through a door is not sent to another: it would
	// only stand there.
	//
	// The walk has a budget, and the budget is the walking. The entrance room is
	// a long corridor of aggressive monkeys: the first version gave the walk
	// forty seconds of wall time, and of the first six walks two crossed - both
	// at thirty-eight seconds - while the four that gave up had been going the
	// right way and stopping for whatever caught them, one of them fighting for
	// all forty. The time a fight holds the walk up does not count against it,
	// and a wall-clock bound far above that ends an intent the fights never let
	// go of.
