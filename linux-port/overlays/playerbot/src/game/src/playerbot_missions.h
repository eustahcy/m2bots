// The two quest lines a bot runs on its own: the Biologist's collections and
// the official level-up hunt.
//
// Both are ordinarily driven by a quest dialog. A bot has no client to press
// Confirm, so the accepting, the counting and the reward are all done here
// against the same quest flags the real quest reads - which is why this is
// bookkeeping rather than behaviour, and why the flag names matter more than
// the code around them.

// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: it
// defines objects, relies on the engine headers playerbot_manager.cpp includes
// above it, and reopens the same anonymous namespace. Include it exactly once,
// after playerbot_gear.h - a finished mission hands out an item.
