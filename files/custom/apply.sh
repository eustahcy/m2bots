#  files/custom/apply.sh -- everything behind "Enable Custom Experience?".
#
#  This is the whole of the answer to that question, in one place, replayable.
#  It exists because the changes below used to be made by hand on one machine:
#  fetch-sources.sh re-stages the server tree from the pristine archive on every
#  assembly, so a hand edit is silently reverted the next time anyone updates,
#  and the only copy of it lives on that one machine. A local test server ended
#  up missing content the live one had, and nobody could say why without
#  comparing two databases.
#
#  What it applies:
#
#      set_pickup_range.py                    600 units on foot, 800 mounted
#      set_horse_summon_always_succeeds.py    calling a horse always works
#      remove_horse_medal_timegates.py        no waiting out real time
#      musk_oil_from_the_general_store.py     the quest points where the oil is
#      stack_skill_books.py                   books of one skill merge into one
#                                             stack; books of different skills
#                                             still never do
#      free_metin_drop_items.py               the metin bonus drops become
#                                             droppable and tradable, and the
#                                             two scrolls stack
#      split_unique_on_equip.py               Experience Rings and Thief's
#                                             Gloves stack; wearing one out of
#                                             the pile takes one out of the pile
#      set_safebox_pages.py                   the storeroom opens with three
#                                             pages instead of one
#      gen_drops.py + targets.txt             a bonus drop group on 283 metins
#                                             and bosses
#      shop_musk_oil.sql                      the oil on the shop's counter
#      safebox_pages.sql                      the same page count in the database
#
#  Called by linux-port/docker/prepare-context.sh when M2_CUSTOM_EXPERIENCE=1 --
#  which is the one moment that works: after the server tree has been staged and
#  before the image is built from it. The two other settings the switch carries,
#  High Risk and the movement-speed bonus, are staged by prepare-context.sh
#  itself because they are quests rather than patches.
#
#  IDEMPOTENT, every step. Run it twice and the second run changes nothing and
#  says so. Each script anchors on an exact known span of text and refuses to
#  guess rather than patch the wrong thing.
#
#  Usage:
#      ./apply.sh --tree <context>/game/src [--schema <context>/panel/schema]
